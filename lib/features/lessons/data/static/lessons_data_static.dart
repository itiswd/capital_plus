    titleOne: 'What is diversification?',
    subtitleOne:
        "Diversification is the strategy of spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk. The basic idea is that when investing in different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.), negative changes in one category can be offset by positive changes in another. For example, if stocks fall in value, bonds may remain stable or even rise. Thus, diversification helps reduce portfolio volatility and preserve capital.",
    titleTwo: "Practical application ",
    subtitleTwo:
        "For effective diversification, it is important to choose assets that have low correlation with each other. This means that the value of assets should change independently of each other. For example, investing in stocks and bonds from different sectors reduces risk compared to investing in only one sector. It is also worth considering geographic diversification by investing in assets from different countries.",
